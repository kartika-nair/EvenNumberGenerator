# Even Number Generator
This is a sequence generator for even numbers (0, 2, 4, 6, ...) which resets to 0 after every cycle. Done as a project for the subject 'Digital Design and Computer Organisation - Laboratory' (UE19CS207).

All codes in this repository have been implemented in Verilog. All output waveforms have been displayed using GTKWave.
- [Algorithmic Implementation](https://github.com/kartika-nair/EvenNumberGenerator/tree/main/Algorithmic) - no circuitry is used in this code
- [Implementation of Circuit](https://github.com/kartika-nair/EvenNumberGenerator/tree/main/Circuit%20Code) - circuit components are used in this code
